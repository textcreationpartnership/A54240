            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Cupid,</hi> Madam, is the little god of Love, a Boy he is, whom the Poets relate to be blind; he has a Bow his Mother <hi>Venus</hi> gave him, and he borrows Arrows from young Ladies Eyes, and when he pleaſes to ſport himſelf, he bends his Bow and ſhoots where he pleaſes, and where ever it hits, that perſon is ſo ſorely wounded, that he can never reſt night nor day, unleſs the Lady from whoſe Eyes the Arrows came, will grant him love again; which is my condition, and if you deny me love I ſhall be of all men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  <p>But why do you ſpeak to me Sir to cure you now you ſay you are wounded? you muſt apply your ſelf to that Lady from whence the Arrows came, as for my part I am ſure that I have no Arrows in me, nor I would not that there ſhould be any there, for all the world; that were the way to kill me if I had Arrows in my Eyes: but if there be Ladies that have any ſuch things that wound young men, and can alſo cure them, you had beſt to ceaſe your diſcourſe with me and ſeek till you find them out; as for my part (as I told you before) I declare that I keep no Arrows to hurt any one, neither (according to your own words) can I cure any that are ſo wounded.</p>

                  <speaker>Corydon,</speaker>
                  <p>Why that very night we muſt go to bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and lie together ſo long as we live.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gelia,</speaker>
                  <p>Oh ſtrange, why then I muſt not marry with you, for that was the only thing that my Mother charged me to have a care of; and not to lye with you,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59388:9"/>nor any other man in the whole World, and I dare not do it if you would give me ſix pence; No, no, I muſt have a care of that, for I know what I know.</p>

                  <speaker>Celia,</speaker>
                  <p>Oh fie, oh fie, now you have named it all that my Mother has forewarned me againſt; how dare you name ſuch words, ſure God wo'nt bleſs you <hi>Corydon.</hi> My Mother told me that God would not bleſs me if I did but think of ſuch things, much leſs dare to act them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Corydon,</speaker>
                  <p>That is to ſay before Marriage <hi>Celia</hi> you ought not to act ſuch things, but marriage makes it lawful with your own husband, and not onely lawful but honourable it is to be a Mother of Children.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Celia,</speaker>

                  <speaker>Corydon,</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Well I'le go home and tell my Mother what you ſay, and ſee whether ſhe will give her conſent that I ſhould do all theſe things with you as you have named or no.</p>

                  <speaker>Hoſteſs,</speaker>
                  <p>VVhy, it follows by confequence, that all men that are married, muſt of neceſſity be Cuckolds, becauſe my Husband's one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tiberius,</speaker>
                  <p>Suppoſe your Husband be one, muſt all men therefore be Cuckolds, becauſe he is ſo? ſurely all the VVomen in the VVorld are not VVhores.</p>

                  <speaker>Rowland,</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, but Landlady, ſetting all aſide, how do you call thoſe VVomen as make their Husbands Cuckalds? if they are not VVhores, I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>

                  <speaker>Hoſteſs,</speaker>
                  <p>Lord Sir, I had thought that you had lived long enough in the World to know better things: Suppoſe I or ſome other VVoman, ſhould be willing to ſatisfie your deſires, in that way, rather then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige you, methinks you would not call me or the or whoever it be, VVhore, for condeſcending to your will.</p>

                  <p>You may ſay ſhe is a kind VVoman, or ſo: a good natur'd VVoman, or ſo: but the name of whore is ſo odious, that it deſerves not to be given for it, except the party ſo called be a common ſtrumpet and mercenary, proſtrating her ſelf to any ſort of fellow, for half a Crown or under; ſhe indeed deſerves the Name of VVhore, and no other VVoman whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

This Young Gentleman had found out a Female Creature that had more Money than Wit, whom he thought were a very fit Match for him: He told me, that he had often made his Addreſſes to her, ſhe not giving him a flat denial, he was perſwaded, that his own Wit, with the aſſiſtance of a ſmooth Poem in praiſe of her Perfections (or Imperfections, all's one in that <hi>Greek</hi> you know <hi>Will.</hi>) might win her, and work upon her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59388:20"/>fooliſh good Nature, ſo far as to accept his ſuit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>And how then <hi>Tom?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I muſt drink the other Glaſs before I can proceed any further with my Story.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, drink and be hang'd, you love this Sack, I perceive.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith <hi>Will.</hi> 'twas well ſaid: Let me drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am hang'd, for I love Sack better than hanging by far.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but go on with the Story.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I told him <hi>Will,</hi> that I could fit him to a hair with a Copy of Verſes, but I exprcted to have ſomething in hand, and a promiſe what I ſhould have after I had done. The young Fop heightred with the thoughts of good ſucceſs, gave me a Guinny in hand, being all the Money he had, I ſuppoſe; and a promiſe of four more if he married the young Gentlewoman: which I gladly took, and could not in Conſcience but give him a glaſs of Wine out of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and you did give him Sack out of his Guinny, did you not <hi>Tom?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Why yes, I tell thee, I did make him drink for his Money; we had two Bottles of Clarer, and that look'd more gentile than one Bottle of Sack, though I muſt confeſs, that I love Sack far better than <hi>French</hi>-Wine, <hi>Will,</hi> and ſo here's to thee.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay I believe that you love Sack well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, without ſwearing to't; for you ſignifie as much by your preſent drinking. Well, now you have took off your Glaſs, I hope you will proceed with your Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning the Poems you were to make.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I will ſo; but had not we beſt to drink another Glaſs apiece firſt: I vow this is excellent good Sack, <hi>Will.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, the Sack's good enough; but prithee be not ſo greedy of it <hi>Tom,</hi> but go on with thy Story.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>VVell here's one Glaſs to thee <hi>VVill,</hi> and then —</p>

                  <speaker>Tom,</speaker>
                  <p>Well, if thou wilt not pledge me <hi>Will,</hi> I'll ſet it by a while, and proceed with my young Gameſter, which was after this manner. I bad him come again that day week he gave me the Guinny, and he ſhould have the Poems.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, thou waſt not a week ſure in compoſing a Copy of Verſes in praiſe of a Ladies Beauty?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>No indeed, I was not <hi>Will;</hi> I wonder how thou hapeneſt to ask ſuch an impertinent Queſtion?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>How do you make it an impertinent Queſtion? did you not ſay, that you bid the Gentleman come that day week, and he ſhould have his Poem?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I did ſay ſo, and do ſay ſo ſtill, and ſay the truth too, Mr. <hi>Will,</hi> and yet that is no good ground for you to ſay that I was a week in making them; I'll ſwear if you were not my Brother Poet, I would call thee Fool. Why, doſt thou not know that I had a Guinny?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I do remember you told me ſo, but what then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>What then, why art thou ignorant ſtill? Doſt thou think that the Guinny would not require ſome time in ſpending?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis right <hi>Tom, I</hi> blame my preſent dulneſs of apprehenſion in not underſtanding thee at firſt; I muſt confeſs that I might have imagined that thou couldſt not reſt, or ſettled thy ſelf to any thing till the Guinny was conſumed and melted away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, as thou ſayeſt <hi>Will,</hi> I did melt it in a ſhore time, but not all at one time; for I would ſtudy and compoſe three or four Lines, then to the Tavern for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59388:21"/>half a pint of the beſt <hi>Canary,</hi> and having drunk up that, I could make a ſhift to go home and compoſe two Verſes and a half more, and then to the Tavern again. But now I think on't, this Wine that ſtands by me, will be flat if it ſtands any longer, therefore <hi>Will,</hi> here's to thee.</p>

When you have a little leiſure from your Latin, I would have you practiſe Writing, which will be a recreation to you; for to be always upon one exerciſe doth dull the ſenſes of any one whether Young or Old, and it would be a comfort to me to have a Letter from you now and then to hear of your welfare: be careful how you ſpend your time, and you ſhall want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I can help you to, that may encourage you to be a good boy, and the way to be ſo, is to live in the fear of God, and to keep his Commandments, then will his Bleſſings for ever attend you, and you will be a joy and comfort to me and your tender Mother in our old Age: Both our Loves remembred to you and your Miſtreſs, I am</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59388:36"/>more convenient place; where with a few flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring words he entices her to make you a Cuckold, which he calls being kind to him; and thus ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth her ſelf on you for not ſubmitting your ſelf to her will in every thing: and 'tis forty to one but ſhe being full of youthful deſire does from that very hour conceive with child by her luſty Gallant, and you forced to Father the Brat of another Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting. But to judge more favourably upon that ſcore, ſuppoſe that ſhe amongſt that ſmall number of her Sex ſhould prove honeſt, yet you muſt be ſure to expect from her a certain charge and trouble, but an uncertain profit and contentment: You muſt be ſure to maintain her fine, and in gay Apparel beyond her quality and the ſtrength of your purſe; elſe will ſhe turn her back-ſide to you in bed at night, and if ſhe be not given to ſcold and rail, then will ſhe be ſullen and dogged a whole Week together, and will not ſpeak but frown upon you till you grant her requeſt; Women for the moſt part being as proud as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> muſt be deck'd up with gorgeous Apparel, to be accounted fine and handſome by the reſt of their Neighbours, not regarding how mean and ſluttiſh they are cloath'd when they are at home with their Husbands. Then for your Houſe though it be made never ſo convenient for your uſe, yet when the Wife comes ſhe pretends to eſpy a thouſand faults in it, and will not let you reſt till you have made ſuch alterations as ſhe ſhall think fit, though it be to the pulling down of the third part of it, and ſo build it again according to her Form; and then for your furniture, alas it will appear too mean for her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; ſhe muſt have Tables and Chairs, and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteds with Curtains, and all manner of Houſhold goods after the new Mode, and if you deny to do it, ſhe will pick your Pocket and buy them her ſelf,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59388:37"/>or do ſomething elſe that is worſe. Thus as a Friend I thought fit to admoniſh you, hoping that you will take it friendly from me; more might be ſaid upon the ſame ſubject, but let this ſuffice from</p>

                  <hi>IN good earneſt I am ſorry to hear that thou haſt ſo great an Averſion to Matrimony, and canſt give no greater, nor more ſubſtantial reaſons why thee and I both ought not to marry and live honeſtly; In my opinion thou mighteſt have beſtowed thy time a great deal better, then to have wrackt thy brains (as I imagine) no leſs than a whole days time if not more, to frame a debauch'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, againſt an honeſt and Virtuous Woman called a Wife, and under pretence of giving me good Advice and Gounſel, thou rather doſt admoniſh me to practiſe that rude courſe of Debauchery, adulterating other honeſt Mens Wives; but dear</hi> Tom <hi>have a care of thoſe things, for I cannot think otherways by thy Letter but thou art guilty of that crime which thou ſo readily perſwadeſt me to commit; and now to acquaint thee with certain News, I muſt tell you that I am married, and therefore can the better confute thy too ſilly ſuppoſitions, knowing of a certain that all thoſe fictions which thou haſt rais'd againſt Marriage, are falſe and of no moment; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for thy better Inſtruction, I ſhall deſire thee to give a diligent attention, whilſt I ſoberly vindicate a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Life and contradict thy fooliſh Objections gradually
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59388:37"/>as thou haſt ſtated them. Firſt, I ſay her Tongue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither is it deſired that it ſhould command my will, no further then I ſhall upon all occaſions think fit and reaſon, if it happens at any time that there is a diſpute between us about the management of any ſmall concern, and ſhe perhaps thinks her way beſt to effect it, and I think mine beſt; ſhe preſently then replyes, prithce Sweet-heart do it how thou pleaſeſt, I only thought good to tell thee my opinion of it; with theſe and ſuch like expreſſions ſhe ſubmits to my will, which I think is far from commanding or uſurping authority as you term it, but I rather receive comfort by her Tongue then ſuffer da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, beſides</hi> Tom <hi>I muſt tell you that my Wife ſings well and pronounces her words with ſuch a becoming Grace, that ſhe never ſpeaks nor ſings but ſhe raviſhes my Soul: So much for the Tongue, and now concerning Money a little touch, be it known to you Sir, ſhe never wants that, for ſhe has the keeping of all I have, therefore hath no occaſion to ask me for any, neither does ſhe go to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns with Goſſips, for we have Wine in our houſe, and every honeſt Neighbour is free to drink of it, and thou</hi> Tom <hi>ſhalt be welcome to a glaſs of brisk Claret, or what Wine thou likeſt beſt if thou wilt come and ſee me, neither am I in the leaſt jealous of being a Cuckold, for I am ſure I pleaſe her ſo well my ſelf, that ſhe will have no occaſion to try and other Man; it is enough for old Men, or thoſe that are feeble and ſickly to be jealous of their Wives honeſty, becauſe they know themſelves not able to give them their due benevolence; I cannot believe that a Woman will make a luſty young Man a Cuckold, if ſhe does in my opinion ſhe deſerves to be hang'd. So much for that, and now to ſum up all the reſt of thy objections which thou haſt made againſt Marriage, in few words I muſt tell thee, that my Wife and every other honeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is contented with her condition in every reſpect, and will not covet new fangles as thou believeſt, but is well

I thank God I know my ſelf clear of thoſe great enormities which are alledged againſt me and laid to my charge, which is a real ſatisfaction to my ſelf, though not to you and the reſt of my friends; and if I may be believed before thoſe inſinnating Sycophants who value not to ſtain a Mans Reputation for a meals Meat: I think I am as little given or addicted to keep ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as any Gentleman in Town, I cannot deny but that I do drink Wine and will do if I can git Money to buy it, and I hope I ſhall not want ſo much as will purchaſe a bottle or two of Wine all my Life-time, but if perchance I do I muſt then leave it off and not before; yet thus much I can ſafely ſay, that I never drunk ſo much, that I was thereby deprived of my ſenſes though I know there is too many which are guilty of that crime.

Another reaſon is that becauſe you have but little or no employment, you are forced to be continually in company which draws you to drinking either at the Tavern or the Ale-houſe by reaſon whereof you looſe your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that you ſeldom have an Appetite to cat, which much diſorders your body; therefore let me adviſe you for your healths ſake to betake your ſelf to a Countrey Life, you know you may be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me at all times, who am</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59388:43"/>ſhould the beſt of Painters ſtrive to draw them out to the life, he would wrong her beauty much; for all his Art could never form ſo rare a Creature: her Cheeks with red and white ſo neatly deckt that you would think the Lilly and the Roſe did ſtrive in them which ſhould have the Victory, till at length they both being conquerours conjoyn together, and center there to make one perfect beauty: Her eyes like two refulgent Diamonds are placed above to caſt a ſplendant luſtre on her ſweet comely face: Her Coral Lips that cloſe her pretty Mouth are of an equal ſize, neither too thick nor yet too thin; Her Teeth more White then is the Ivory, like to two Rows of ineſtimable Pearl ſtand in a decent order in her Mouth, none ſtriving for preheminence above their fellows. Her Hair which on this Globe of Wiſdom grows more White then is the beſt of Flax by far, and ſofter then the unwrought Silk that comes from the Bowels of the labouring Silk-worm, like to the ſmalleſt threds of Silver hangs two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls down below her ſlender Waſt; Her Neck an Ivory Pillar is on which this Globe doth ſtand, but whiter is by far, her Arms two branches are, which do proceed forth from the bottom of her Neck for to defend and keep ſecure that curious piece her Face: Her Breaſts like to two little Hills are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on either ſide of a moſt fruitful Valley; Her Belly round and ſmooth but not too big, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, oh there dear <hi>Jack,</hi> oh there the place of pleaſure grows; but hold rude Pen forbear to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or once to mention any more of that, for fear great <hi>Jove</hi> ſhould be my Rival too, and on his <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymede</hi> come hovering down and take away my Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of ſuch worth.

               <p>I <hi>Received your large Epiſtle wherein I underſtand that you have been a great Traveller, ſine? I ſaw you to ſearch after a handſome woman that you could fancy well
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59388:44"/>enough to make her your Spouſe, I am heartily glad that you have been ſo ſucceſsful at length to meet with ſuch an Angel-like Beauty, which if all be true as you have reported to me ſhe is to be admired above all the Women in the whole world, but however if ſhe ſhould not be altogether ſo amiable and glorious as you relate her to be, I cannot ſo much blame you; for it is but verifying the Proverb which we uſe here in</hi> England, <hi>which is, that Old Men and Travellers may Romance by authority, I will not ſay lie</hi> Tom <hi>for that is a groſs word, and I very well remember that my Maſter once did whip me ſeverely for giving one of my School-fellows the lie, which will be a memorandum for me as long as I live, for you know that according to another Proverb the burnt Child dreads the fire, ſo much for that: Now I will alſo give you a full deſcription of my Miſtreſs which I have pickt up in your abſence if you will: I did not go far to ſeek her, for ſhe had ſuch a monſtrous love for me that ſhe began to declare her affections to me firſt after this manner; Kind Sir quoth ſhe, though it is not the cuſtom among us Engliſh women to make our application to Men for any thing, though we have never ſo much mind to it, yet I think it is a great wrong to our whole Sex; for we may ſtay long enough before you will proffer us any kindneſs now a days, I am ſure I can ſpeak with ſorrow upon my own account that I have been marriageble above theſe twenty years, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet was askt that reaſonable queſtion by any Man, I know not what ſhould be the reaſon of it, I am not ſo much deformed but that I may be beloved; however what I want in beauty, I am ſure I can make good in Eſtate, for I have Lands and Livings with Baggs of Gold and Silver innumerable; therefore my ſuit to you dear Sir is that you would be pleaſed to take pitty on a diſtreſſed Virginity, by making of me your lawful Wife for now I begin to hate a ſingle Life. I hearing

I know you underſtand the way of malting well, now I ſhould think that it would be a fine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to you for to ride up and down the Markets to buy in Corn at the beſt ſeaſon of the year, and ſo keep Men to manage your buſineſs at home; thus might you buſie your ſelf and reap the fruits and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of your own labour; beſides it would be mighty commendable and credible for you to be accounted a Man of buſineſs, and if perhaps this way of dealing does not anſwer your expectation as to matter of profit; you may ſoon lay it aſide and betake your ſelf to ſomething elſe that you fancy will be more advantageous to you; for there is a thouſand ways for a Man that has ready Money to improve it, and gain more by it then at the rate of ſix <hi>per Cent</hi> to let it out to Uſury; beſides if you got never ſo little by your employment, yet I would have you follow it, for it will keep you from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is the Mother of ſhame and beggery; more might be ſaid of that, but I ſuppoſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand enough of thoſe things, if you would but practiſe according to your knowledge; be ſure to

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59388:53"/>the old rate in ſpight of reaſon and diſcretion, who are your utter enemies, inſomuch that you cannot abide them, but hate them with a perfect hatred; nor will you ſuffer them to come within your doors: Oh blind stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity! 'tis well my Father left thee a good Eſtate; elſe hadſt thou been left to live by thy Wits, I am ſure thou muſt have ſtarved the firſt week after his deceaſe: but he was a wiſe Man that did foreſee thoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that hou wast born to, and ſo prevented poverty from coming to thy doors; yet thou with fear of want canſt ſcarcely rest, and without cruſe doſt thou pinch thy ſelf and thy Family, not having Wit enough to know one half of that Eſtate which thou hast left thee, nor how to make the beſt uſe of it; that ſo thou wilt miſerably live to thy Lives end, though indeed thou canst not want: prithee Brother let me adviſe thee to leave thy babling in pretending to give me counſel, and I think the better way will be to come and live with me, or let me come and live with you, and leave but the management of thy Eſtate to my diſpoſing, I'le warrant thee we will live like Princes, and never want any thing elſe that Money can obtain: and this I am ſure will be the best for thee to live at content, for now I know you live in fear; thus wiſhing that you would take my counſel is all at preſent from</hi>

               <p>IN conſidering your welfare, and taking a ſhort view into your preſent concerns; I cannot but think that it is altogether inconvenient for you to lead a ſingle Life any longer, for ſince you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken your ſelf to Houſe-keeping and the ordering of a Family, I am ſure that it would be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to marry a Wife, whoſe care (if ſhe perform her duty) will be always within doors, and ſee that thoſe Servants you keep do not waſte nor make laviſh of any proviſion, or otherways, what Goods you ſhall commit to their charge in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence when you are abroad about your earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; expecting all to be well and carefully mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home: but alas you may be miſtaken in a Houſe-keeper or a Servant-Maid, for they oftentimes do combine and have ſelf-concern with the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, to the great detriment and almoſt ruine of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral young Men like your ſelf, who have put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them; this as the firſt and no ſmall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I bring to diſſwade you from living ſingle, and to perſwade you to betake your ſelf to a Wiſe: The next reaſon is this which you muſt pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſpoken particularly concerning you, neither does it exclude you; but it may be very properly attributed to any ſingle Man which is a Houſe-keeper: Suppoſe then this, that a young Man as you are does at ſometime or other meet with ſome of his good friends or former companions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad as he is walking about his lawful occaſion, and being glad to ſee each other, you cannot well part without drinking a glaſs or two of Wine together
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59388:61"/>thereby to ſignifie your mutual loves and friendſhip which you mutually do owe, and having ſate a while in the Tavern one Bottle many times begets two or three, or may be more and ſtill loth to part, till it oftentimes is ſeen that the Wine doth predominate over your reaſons at that time and you ſtay late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elevated with thoſe charming liquors you at length return home, and having no body to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you there but your Servant-Maid, it may be in that humour (though not in the leaſt inclined to it another time) you begin to be familiar with your Maid (and ſo familiar as is unſeemly for me to name though you may gueſs my meaning) this Maid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance though honeſt heretofore, yet conſidering that you are her Maſter and ſhe but of a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or quality contrary to her natural cuſtom, may ſubmit her ſelf and willingly condeſcend to what you ſhall earneſtly deſire to enjoy, which being granted you, on the morrow when 'tis too late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you of the Fact, and may perchance be brought to open ſhame quickly after for ſuch your deed as you have committed; or elſe forc'd to marry her whom you have already ſtrumpeted: this cautional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I adviſe you of, not that I know you in the leaſt guilty, but I am ſure a good Wife (of which ſort there are many) would prevent all theſe miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of youth, and be a great comfort to you both night and day, therefore pray take my counſel, and think ne're the worſe of him who cordially is</p>

               <p>AFter my Love remembred unto you, truſting in God that you are in good health as I was at this preſent writing, with my Father and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Brothers and Siſters, and Unkles and Aunts, and the reſt of my good Friends thanks be to God for it. The cauſe of my writing to you at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59388:66"/>this time is, that I hear <hi>Joan</hi> ſince my coming from <hi>Weſton,</hi> when you know what talk we had together there at the ſign of the <hi>Horns,</hi> and how you did give me your hand and ſwear that you would not forſake me for all the World, and how you made me buy you a Ring and a Heart that coſt me two and twenty pence, and I left them with you, and you gave me a Napkin to wear in my Hat and a ſmall Feather, I thank you, which I will wear to my dying day, and I marvel if it be true as I hear, that you have altered your mind, and are made ſure to my Neighbour <hi>Pigsay's</hi> Son. Truly <hi>Joan</hi> you do not well in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and God will plague you for it: and I hope I ſhall live well enough if I never have you; for there are more Maids in the World beſides you <hi>Joan,</hi> and truly I count my ſelf worth the whiſtling after, I am ſure there are ſome young Maids about us will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of me, and be glad to leap at me to have ſuch Honey kiſſes <hi>Joan</hi> as I uſed to give you; therefore be not ſo high and ſo proud <hi>Joan</hi> and ſo ſcornful, for if you will have none of me, I will have none of you, but will be as ſtout and as coy as any handſome Maid in <hi>England;</hi> for you know my old Grandſir has left my Father good Houſe and Land, and my Father will give it to me his own Son I am ſure, and therefore praying you to write me your Anſwer by this Bearer my friend, touching the truth of all how it ſtands with you, I commit you to God:</p>

               <p>I Am ſorry to tell thee that I hear thy diligence doth not anſwer my deſire, and I would gladly wiſh it otherwiſe, but I hope a kind admonition will ſuffice to work a on good Nature, and therefore will rather hope the beſt then doubt the contrary: and in the love of a Father let me entreat thee to avoid the company of a lewd fellow, as rather an enemy then a Friend. The Feminine Sex are dangerous to affect, for as they will be a loſs of time, ſo with hinderance of ſtudy they will produce expence:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59388:67"/>The exerciſe of thy body I admit for thy health, but let thy Love be in thy Learning, elſe wilt thou never be a good Scholar, for deſire and delight are the beſt Maſters both of Art and Knowledge, whilſt vertuous Reaſon makes Underſtanding gracious: Therefore not out of the bitter humour of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the careful Nature of affection I write unto thee for thy own good, and as nothing can joy the heart of a Father more then the obedience of a loving child, ſo can there nothing be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then the ſtubborn ſpirit of an ungracious Son; I ſpeak this to thee knowing thy years and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding able to digeſt the conſideration of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which in ſum is my joy in thy good.

               <p>I <hi>Received a Letter with your Name to it, and directed to me; but ſure if it came from you it was never intended for me, but for ſome other Woman, but yet not ſatisfied that you could make ſuch a miſtake; I upon a ſecond conſideration do fear that you are fell diſtracted: for ſurely had you that natural ſince now, that you had when I departed from you; the Letter you ſent would not have been directed to me but to ſome Miſtreſs or ſmall Harlot of yours, whoſe fidelity you ſo much doubted and feared that ſhe had to do with more Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies beſides your ſelf; but to come a little cloſer to the buſineſs, I partly ſmell out your deſign when you writ that Letter, you are jealous of me though without cauſe, yet fain would hide your jealouſie under the pretence of giving me good counſel; Introth Husband you know I am young, but not ſo much a Child but I can perceive what you aim at: Alas poor Man! what does your head ake before you have any occaſion for it?

                  <hi>Sweet Sir,</hi> I admire that I have never ſeen you all this while, I hope my looks did not fright you when you were laſt at our houſe, if ſome of your quality had but half the invitation as I have given you, I ſhould have ſeen them often in this time; but 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah Madam!</hi> Impute not my ſo long abſence to be any neglect of mine, for had I been at my own diſpoſing I would ſcarcely have been ever from you; but ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> If Love be blind as ſome Men ſay he is, I wonder how he come to hit my heart ſo right, he has wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me and 'twas in darkneſs too, and ſo that none but you alone can cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I wonder why ſo many young Men talk of <hi>Cupid</hi> and his Feather'd Darts that wounds their breaſts and yet they know not when. In my opinion they are much miſtaken, for Love proceeds at firſt from each others eyes; and after that want of enjoyment of a beauty once ſeen may cauſe a kind of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome paſſion to ariſe, and this is my belief concerning Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me deſire you as you love your ſelf to fly from this infected place, where nothing but Murthers and Rapes are daily threatned, I heard but the other day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You may imagine that I love you, elſe I ſhould not have carried my ſelf in ſuch a familiar manner as I did laſt night to you who were ſo much a ſtranger to me, perhaps you may think me wanton but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me beg of you not to remember my paſt ſaults, but forget an I forgive them all, burying them in oblivion, and for the future I will be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of offending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me deſire you not to regard the vulgar report of the common ſort of people, for they will ſay any thing: Neither do they regard who it is they wrong, exclaiming againſt any perſon behind his back whom juſt before they applauded before his Face, and this is their common courſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Life of my Soul,</hi> Let not my abſence provoke thee ſo far as to be jealous of my inconſtancy for thus much aſſure thy ſelf, that where ever I am my heart is with thee, and nothing but death ſhall alter my reſolutions, which are to make thee my Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Never doubt nor fear but firſt of all make Tryal; experience is the beſt Miſtreſs; I doubt not but that ſhe will be kind, and that all things may ſucceed according to your deſire.</p>
               <p>Thouſands you know have miſcarried for want of making a quick purſuit in ſuch concerns as yours are; you know that a place of good preferment is ſoon catcht up.</p>
               <p>Conſult with reaſon firſt, and be not over-raſh in your attempts, leſt you precipitate your whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

               <p>I grant your ſure Sir if your love be true, but firſt you muſt give me leave to make trial of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that many have been beguil'd by ſmooth tongues and flattering ſpeeches, but mine you have no reaſon to miſtruſt.</p>
               <p>Conſent not Daughter to their falſe deluſions, for now a days not one Gallant amongſt ten is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; let your love be grounded on what I ſhall think reaſon, then will you live a happy life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>My Father's good will, Sir, you firſt muſt ask be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall make my ſelf any ſurer to you, yet this I will tell you, if what you demand be according to his good liking, I can ſatisfie you, that I ſandy you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other Man.</p>

               <p>Your buſineſs Sir I have carefully minded, which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59388:82"/>ſucceeds according to your wiſh, the Man you told me was your chiefeſt witneſs I met in Town, and have ſecured him till the Trial ſhall be, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his evidence I queſtion not but that you in your ſute will prove victorious.</p>
               <p>I had ſooner been with you, Sir, had not my Horſe tired by the way; inſomuch that I was forced to lie ſtill two whole days, becauſe he was not able to perform the Journey.</p>
               <p>Your Letters of advice, Sir, came too late, for I had then diſpatched the buſineſs before their arrival; however if I can ſerve you in the like nature I ſhall gladly be commanded by you.</p>
               <p>No more your aged Father's counſel diſreſpect, leaſt that I count it wilful diſobedience, what I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to is for your own advantage, as yet you know the power is in my hands to make you happy or for ever miſerable.</p>
               <p>I hope you cannot juſtly task me, Sir, with diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for rather then I would prove undutiful to ſo good a Father, I would make choice of my ſharp pointed Sword to be my fatal Executioner.</p>
               <p>I know your clemency and well diſpoſed mind is apter to forgive my faults, then I can have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence to ask your pardon; pray Sir, be therefore ſatisfied in my proteſtations that I not only love, but alſo honour you.</p>
               <p>I ſhall endeavour ſo to uſe my time to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my future good, that you my aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may have joy and comfort at all times when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you ſee my face.</p>

               <p>Learning I know is a moſt precious Jewel, not to be obtained without a careful ſtudy and induſtry; my diligence ſhall therefore be to the utmoſt of my power to acquire to my ſelf ſo rich a gem which is of that great value.</p>
               <p>You know that none ſhall ever reap the profit of your Learning but your ſelf, therefore my child ſeek it and thou ſhalt have it.</p>
               <p>I am glad to hear that you are merry, for it is a ſign that you are in health, but let me adviſe you Child, to have a care, that Vanity take not up too much Room in your mind and heart, ſupplying that place which ſhould contain profounder knowledge, ſtealing away your thoughts from following better things.</p>
               <p>I always, Sir, do conſult with reaſon in my affairs before I pitch upon any deſign; therefore after I have had ſome ſmall time to deliberate my thoughts I ſhall be ready and willing to give you my opinion and beſt judgement in this matter.</p>
               <p>Love is a thing that I never yet ſtudied, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you tell me ſtrange news about it; but I will conſider on't, and if I find I can love any Man it ſhall be you as ſoon as any body I know of.</p>
               <p>But ſince our Parents angry are and will not give their conſents that we ſhould marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am reſolved if you will agree to appoint a time, when privately we may make our ſelves happy though againſt their wills.</p>
               <p>'Tis true I love, and that you know full well, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59388:83"/>willingly would have our Friend's good will, yet ſince you are reſolved to take me at a venture, name but the time and I will ſurely meet you, for I had rather offend all my friends, then in the leaſt to prove unkind or fickle to thee my deareſt Love and only joy.</p>
               <p>Admire not that I appear to be ſomewhat ſtrange to your propoſitions, for I know that you have ever been unconſtant; therefore I ſhall be careful how I ſettle my affections on a ſudden.</p>
               <p>Stoop not ſo low as once to condeſcend to act ſuch folly, for ruine will attend all thoſe that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration match themſelves to ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy.</p>
               <p>I heartily could wiſh the time were come that both our hearts and hands might be united, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would run a lawful courſe, yet hardly can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſtay ſo long; why ſhould I be delayed from that ſweet enjoyment which every night I dream on without redreſs, 'tis real pleaſure that I want my dear.</p>
